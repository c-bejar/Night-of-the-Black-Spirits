### Information
This is my very first Godot project shortly after finishing [The Ultimate Introduction to Godot](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nAh_Kx5Zh5Q)  by Clear Code.
This took me about a week, but there are still a couple of things I'd like to add such as:
- Persistent High Score
- Proper Menu and Pausing
- Items to grab to help you
- Other Enemies
